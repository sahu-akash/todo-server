Back-end
• The API should be written in the NodeJS
• You can use a JSON file which can have few to do items already in it. (5~10 items will be
enough)


• Each item should have the following properties at least:
o ID
o Text
o Done or pending


• One endpoint should provide all the “to do” items to the front-end.

• Another endpoint can be used to update the “Done or pending” state of any to do item
• Updates should be saved in the JSON file


















Front-end
• Front-end should be in ReactJS
• The application should get all the “to do” items from the back-end API and present it on the
screen
• Each item should show somehow the “Done” or “Pending state”. For example, the done
items can have a line-through text for example Write an email to the professor
• Clicking on any item should update it’s “Done or pending” state.
• You can style it however you feel good
Things that we will pay attention to
• Coding style
• Testing
• GIT history
